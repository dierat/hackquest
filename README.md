#Hack Quest

A turn-based battle rpg where the valiant students at Hack Reacor battle the malevolent technologies of web development.

Inspired by traditional turn-based role-playing games like Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest and built with Meteor and MongoDB, Hack Quest is a lighthearted game about learning to program. Students can code, google, or use giphy (a gif-posting bot for the workplace communications app Slack) while the languages and tools produce bugs and confuse the students with poor documentation.
